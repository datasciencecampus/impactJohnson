#+TITLE: Impact Johnson

Just a bit of fun. Some really basic analysis of tweets.
The code is a mess, its not even remotely optimised and it could be a little
bit cleverer, but it does what I intended it to given the 20 minutes I spent on
it.

*Note*: this is Impact Johnson.


* Usage

Edit ~scraper.py~ so that the function runs on the account you want it to.

Then
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh
python scraper.py
ghc -o impactJohnson Main.hs
. impactJohnson
#+END_EXAMPLE


* Caveats

I did not write the scraper, that comes from
[[https://marcobonzanini.com/2015/03/02/mining-twitter-data-with-python-part-1/][here]].
